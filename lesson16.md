### More stuff to do!

You don't have to do all of this, these are just ideas!



* allow the users to open the article (with a link)
* add `next` and `previous` pages buttons
* Show loading while the data is being fetched.
* Show the news site
* Show the articles creation or publishing date.
* Allow the user to search for keywords
  * In the title
  * Or summary
  * Or both!
* Or show article earlier or later than a certain date

### More advanced?

* Allow the user to read the article, by embedding the article in an iframe
* Automatically load more elements when the user scrolls to the end
