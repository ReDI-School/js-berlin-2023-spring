> It does not matter what we cover, but what you discover
>
> \- ~Noam Chomsky~ Victor Weisskopf

(recently learned that the quote is by Victor Weisskopf, a famous physicist, but it's often attributed to Chomsky because he mentioned in some interviews. Still a good quote.)

### Questions

- don't be shy (or scared), ask questions!
  - as many as possible
- interrupt us
- there are no bad questions
- ask us to repeat
- if something is not clear to you, it's likely that it's not clear for others

### Pillars of Web Development

| HTML | CSS | JavaScript |
| ---- | --- | ---------- |
| ![HTML5](images/HTML5_Logo.svg) <!-- .element height="64px" width="64px" --> | ![CSS3](images/css3.svg) <!-- .element height="64px" width="64px" --> | ![JS](images/javascript-logo.svg) <!-- .element height="64px" width="64px" --> |
| *Content* |  *Presentation* | *Dynamic Effects* |
| Nouns | Adjectives | Verbs |

```html
<p>Hey</p>  <!-- HTML: Adds a paragraph -->
```

```css
p { color: red; }  /* CSS: Makes the paragraph red */
```

```js
p.remove(); // JavaScript: removes the paragraph
```

### JavaScript (JS) - What is it?

* JS is a *programming language* (*scripting language*)
* JS allows you to implement dynamic content and effects

* 1998: ES2 released
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* 1999: ES3 released
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* umm...
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* ZZzzzzz...
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="6" -->
* 2009: ES5 released
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->
* 2015: ES6 released
